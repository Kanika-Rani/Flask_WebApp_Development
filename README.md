Flask WebApp Development - REGEX MMATCHER AND EMAIL VALIDATOR

This is a simple web application built using Flask that provides two interfaces:

* A Regex Matcher for matching text against regular expressions.
* An Email Validation interface to check if a given email address is valid.
## Features
* Regex Matcher: Input a regular expression and a string to see if there is a match.
* Email Validation: Enter an email address, and the app will validate its format.

## Technologies Used
* Python
* Flask
* HTML/CSS
* Regex (re module)

## Sample Usage
### Regex Matcher:
* Enter a regular expression (e.g., ^[A-Za-z]+$) and a string (e.g., Hello), and click the "Match" button. The app will show whether the string matches the pattern.
### Email Validation:
* Enter an email (e.g., test@example.com) and click "Validate". The app will return whether the email format is valid.
